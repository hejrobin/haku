<sup>A tiny web application framework with big ambitions.</sup>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Haku is still in development, and is not meant for production use right now, but do feel free to test it out and discuss.

Haku is a small, opinionated web application framework built for JSON APIs. It aims to have a small footprint without any external dependencies or extensions, relying on native PHP 8.3 features.

## Features & Philosophies

#### ‚ú® Native Features First

Haku aims to have a small footprint, without any external dependencies and relies soley on the power of native [PHP 8.3 features](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3/en.php).

#### ‚ú® Testing Is Built In

Haku ships with a simple test/spec runner inspired by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Writing tests for your code should be quick and easy, Haku tries to help with that.

#### ‚ú® Useful Tooling

Ships with a tiny command line interface, a built in development server and code generators.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `php haku-init`| Creates required configuration files, for initial setup |
| `php haku env` | Creates, or refreshes an already defined environment |
| `php haku serve`|  Starts a development server using [PHP's built in server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php). |
| `php haku make <generator>`|  Invokes one of the code generators that Haku ships with, run `php haku make --help` to see available generators. |

## FAQ

#### ‚ùáÔ∏è Why doesn't Haku use Composer?

I wanted to build a framework that has a "_batteries included_" kind of philosophy, without external dependencies, just the bare minimum needed to create a JSON API.
  
While [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is an amazing and convenient tool, it isn't really the approach I wanted for Haku.

#### ‚ùáÔ∏è Does Haku follow any coding standards guidelines?

Yes, Haku follows [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/).
